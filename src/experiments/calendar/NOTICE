This WebExtension Experiment is based on the draft for the Calendar API
created by @kewisch, avaialble at
https://github.com/thundernest/tb-web-ext-experiments/tree/master/calendar

Changes:
- do not use resource://-URI schema to prevent collisions with other add-ons
  using different versions of the same API.
- add calISchedulingSupport to provided calendars to fix display issues
- add support for 'mutable' capability, permitting to provide read-only
  calendars (forces readOnly property to be true)
- altered calendars.query to compare URIs directly instead of using
  the undefined (?) function parseMatchPatterns, as the obvious replacement
  (new MatchPatternSet) is not properly working with non-web schemas.
